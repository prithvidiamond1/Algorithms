# Algorithms
This is a repo made solely for my convenience of being able refer to the algorithms I learn and write but I also thought it might help whoever finds it (depends on if I leave public in the future or make private).

The algorithms are written primarily in python.

The following algorithms are present at current:
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A* search
- DFS
- BFS
- Custom Maze Generators
